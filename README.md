## What is it?
We built a web crawler to get the information on IMDB.com. 
Movies take an important role of our daily life and there are more and more good movies nowadays. However, it is too hard to find the information you want efficiently from such a large amount of data. 
Web Crawler is a very flexible way to get data. We can basically crawl all the webpages we can see on the web and crawl the data we need in the format we want. After we get all these data, we can use these information to do further analysis and research such as customers’ behaviors.

**Xueba web crawler** is a tool to find data from all the feature films on **IMDB.com**, which is sorted by popularity ascending. It aims to catrgorize top 500 feature films into different film genres. We are using practical, **real world** data analysis in Python. Additionally, it has the broader goal to graphically display the rating, frenquency and scores of the top 500 outstanding movies. It is already well on its way towards this goal and we want to develop and add more functions of this tool accourding to practical needs.
