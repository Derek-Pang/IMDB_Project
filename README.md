Movies take an important role of our daily life and there are more and more good movies nowadays. However, it is too hard to find the information you want efficiently from such a large amount of data. 

Web Crawler is a very flexible way to get data. We can basically crawl all the webpages we can see on the web and crawl the data we need in the format we want. After we get all these data, we can use these information to do further analysis and research such as customersâ€™ behaviors.

We are going to build a web crawler to get the information on IMDB.com.
